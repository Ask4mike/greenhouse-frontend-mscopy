## Tech Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) with [React](https://reactjs.org)
- **CSS Framework:** Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Testing Framework:** Jest for unit testing
- **Version Control:** Git and GitHub for collaboration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following software is installed on your local machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (v14+)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Techies-Collab-and-Upskill-Live-Project/Greenhouse-frontend.git
   cd Greenhouse-frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```
   The application will run at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (or another port if 5173 is occupied).

## Development Workflow

1. **Branching Strategy:**

   - Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-feature-name
     ```
   - After completing your changes, commit with clear and descriptive messages:
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Add product listing component"
     ```

2. **Pushing Changes:**

   - Push your branch to the remote repository:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-feature-name
     ```

3. **Creating Pull Requests (PRs):**
   - Open a PR on GitHub, assign a team member for review, and ensure the changes meet project guidelines before merging.

## Testing

We are using Jest for unit testing. Ensure tests are written for components and utility functions.
To run tests:

```bash
npm run test
# or
yarn test
```

## Building for Production

To create a production-ready build, run:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `dist/` directory.

## Deployment

Deployment is handled via [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Check out the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for details on how to deploy the application.
