## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

Git
Local Development Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Techies-Collab-and-Upskill-Live-Project/Greenhouse-frontend.git
cd Greenhouse-frontend
Install dependencies:

npm install

# or if you're using yarn

yarn install
Start the development server:

npm run dev

# or

yarn dev
The application should now be running at http://localhost:5173 (or another port if 5173 is occupied).

Development Workflow
Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix:

git checkout -b your-feature-name
Make your changes, commit them with clear messages:

git commit -m "Add product listing component"
Push your branch and create a pull request on GitHub

Assign a team member to review your PR

Address any feedback and merge once approved

Testing
Write unit tests for components and utility functions
Run tests before pushing your changes:
npm run test

# or

yarn test
Building for Production
To create a production build:

npm run build

# or

yarn build
This will generate optimized files in the dist/ directory.

Deployment
(We will discuss this later)

Team Communication
We use WhatsApp for daily communication
Use GitHub Issues for task tracking and discussions
Update the project board on GitHub with your progress
